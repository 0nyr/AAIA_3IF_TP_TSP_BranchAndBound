# Generated fully connected graphs

The files in this folder have been generated using [this program](https://github.com/0nyr/prim_algorithm).

A test file is as follows:

```
n // number of nodes in the fully-connected graph
X X X X X // cost matrix
X X X X X
X X X X X
X X X X x
nbNodesNotInMSTfromBaseGraph // nb of nodes (with greatest index) not to be included in the MST
expectedMSTcost // computed cost of the MST from the 
```
